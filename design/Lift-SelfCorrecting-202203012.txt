Lift Self-Correcting logic to prevent the Lift arms from slowly creeping upward during the match.
In ClimberSubsystem constructor
	Reset Climber encoders on Falcon motors. (talonFX.encoder.reset)
	Initialize self-Correction variables (init values)
		minEncoder = 0 
		maxValue = 14900
		safetyOffset = 3506
		midValue = (maxEncoder + minEncoder)/2  (value=7450)
		selfCorrection = true // self-correction flag
In Robot.teleOpInit
	Go back to init Values
While Robot is running (teleOp mode)
	In Climber subsystem
	If (selfCorrection==true)
	Check encoder value talonFX.getSensorCollection.getIntegratedSensorAbsolutePosition
	When encoderValue is > (maxValue - safetyOffset)
		Lower Arm to midValue
	If climberButtonPressed Then disable SelfCorrection
		selfCorrection = false

Disable SelfCorrection (override) by pressing Start button  (to start using the Lift manually)
Re-Enable SelfCorrection by pressing Back button  (re-enable SelfCorrection, stop using the Lift manually)
